# genmap

Specialized hash maps for integer types in Go.

The builtin maps of Go are good but sometimes you need some extra
performance.

This library offers specialized hash maps from A to B
with A and B from all of `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`,
`uint`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32` and `uint64`.
